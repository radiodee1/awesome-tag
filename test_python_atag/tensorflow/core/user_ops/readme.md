# README

The cpu version of this op is part of the set of files named `assemble_boxes_gpu`. The gpu op is located there also. The `assemble_boxes.cc` file is included for testing of the build environment. It has no other function. 

The gpu op is a little bit unpredictable, but will process large data sets. The cpu op is totally predictable but uses up lots of ram.
