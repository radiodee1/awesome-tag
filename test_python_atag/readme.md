Facial detection and tagging experiments -- this project was not working for several months. Presently, though, it does a better job of detection than it did. It does not, however, do that detection any faster than before. It presently takes several minutes for each image.

The method used for detection can be described as follows. All the code is written in python. First a program devides the image into small boxes, 7 pixels to a side. Then a simple two layer neural network is used to determine which of these boxes are areas of the image where a face might be. This layer basically detects skin tones. Then an aggregating program is used to draw together squares that are immediately adjacent. Then a more sophisticated convolutional neural network is used to determine which of these resulting boxes is actually a face.
